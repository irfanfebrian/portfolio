				<p>I'm a&nbsp;<del>&nbsp;designer&nbsp;</del>&nbsp;problem solver based on Jakarta, Indonesia. I like to approach design by mirroring the principles of evolution. Only the fittest entity will survive and thrive. Most of the time, it is the simple one that always succeed in adapting themselves ‚Äî best for the environment. </p>
				<p>Believe that design should start with the essential.</p>
				<p>Before we show the interesting layout, shape and color, first we have to craft what we have, to be a thing that is helpful, understandable & easy to use without sacrificing their true aim. Then, the beauty will follow later.</p>
